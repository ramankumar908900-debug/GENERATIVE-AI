Python code refers to the set of instructions written in the Python programming language to tell a computer what to do. Python is known for its clean and easy-to-read syntax, which makes it a popular choice for beginners as well as professionals. Python code is written using simple English-like commands, which helps programmers focus more on logic rather than complicated rules.

A Python program usually includes variables to store data, operators to perform calculations, conditions to make decisions, loops to repeat tasks, and functions to organize the code. Python is widely used in many fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and game development. Because of its powerful libraries and user-friendly nature, Python code allows you to create everything from small scripts to large, complex applications.
